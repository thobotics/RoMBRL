PYSGMCMC is a Python framework for Bayesian Deep Learning that focuses on 
Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. 

Features
========
* **Complex samplers as black boxes**, computing the next sample with corresponding costs of any MCMC sampler is as easy as:

.. code-block:: python

   sample, cost = next(sampler)

* Based on `tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ that provides:
    * efficient numerical computation via data flow graphs
    * flexible computation environments (CPU/GPU support, desktop/server/mobile device support)
    * Linear algebra operations
