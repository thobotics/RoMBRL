    Compute pymc3 diagnostic defined by callable `pymc3_diagnostic_fun`

    Parameters
    ----------
    get_sampler : callable
        Callable that takes a `tensorflow.Session` as input and returns a
        (possibly already "burnt-in")
        `pysgmcmc.sampling.MCMCSampler` subclass instance.

    pymc3_diagnostic_fun : callable
        Callable that takes a `pymc3.MultiTrace` object as input and
        returns some diagnostic value for the chains in that `pymc3.MultiTrace`.

    n_chains : int, optional
        Number of individual chains/traces to extract.
        Defaults to `2`.

    samples_per_chain : int, optional
        Number of samples each individual chain should contain.
        Defaults to `100`.

    ----------
    diagnostic_output
        Diagnostic result computed by pymc3.

    Calculate ess metric for a sampler returned by callable `get_sampler`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    get_sampler : callable
        Callable that takes a `tensorflow.Session` as input and returns a

    samples_per_chain : int, optional

    Returns
    ----------
    ess : dict
        Dictionary that maps the variable name of each target parameter of a
        sampler obtained by callable `get_sampler` to the corresponding
        effective sample size of (each dimension of) this variable.

    Notes
    ----------
    The diagnostic is computed as:

    .. math:: \\hat{n}_{eff} = \\frac{mn}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t=1}^T  \\hat{\\rho}_t}

    where :math:`\\hat{\\rho}_t` is the estimated autocorrelation at lag t, and T
    is the first odd positive integer for which the sum
    :math:`\\hat{\\rho}_{T+1} + \\hat{\\rho}_{T+1}` is negative.

def gelman_rubin(get_sampler, n_chains=2, samples_per_chain=100):
    r"""
    Calculate gelman_rubin metric for a sampler returned by callable `get_sampler`.
    To do so, extract `n_chains` traces with `samples_per_chain` samples each.

    The Gelman-Rubin diagnostic tests for lack of convergence by comparing
    the variance between multiple chains to the variance within each chain.
    If convergence has been achieved, the between-chain and within-chain
    variances should be identical. To be most effective in detecting evidence
    for nonconvergence, each chain should have been initialized to starting
    values that are dispersed relative to the target distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    get_sampler : callable
        Callable that takes a `tensorflow.Session` as input and returns a
        (possibly already "burnt-in")
        `pysgmcmc.sampling.MCMCSampler` subclass instance.

    n_chains : int, optional
        Number of individual chains/traces to extract.
        Defaults to `2`.

    samples_per_chain : int, optional
        Number of samples each individual chain should contain.
        Defaults to `100`.

    Returns
    ----------
    gelman_rubin : dict
      Dictionary of the potential scale reduction factors, :math:`\\hat{R}`.

    Notes
    ----------

    The diagnostic is computed by:

      .. math:: \\hat{R} = \\frac{\\hat{V}}{W}

    where :math:`W` is the within-chain variance and :math:`\\hat{V}` is
    the posterior variance estimate for the pooled traces. This is the
    potential scale reduction factor, which converges to unity when each
    of the traces is a sample from the target posterior. Values greater
    than one indicate that one or more chains have not yet converged.
