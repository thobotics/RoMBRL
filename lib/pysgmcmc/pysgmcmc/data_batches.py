    """ Infinite generator of random minibatches for a dataset.

        For general reference on (infinite) generators, see:
        https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray (N, D)
        Training data points/features

    y : np.ndarray (N, 1)
        Training data labels

    x_placeholder : tensorflow.placeholder
        Placeholder for batches of data from `x`.

    y_placeholder : tensorflow.placeholder
        Placeholder for batches of data from `y`.

    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of datapoints to put into a batch.

    seed: int, optional
        Random seed to use during batch generation.
        Defaults to `None`.

    Yields
    -------
    batch_dict : dict
        A dictionary that maps `x_placeholder` and `y_placeholder`
        to `batch_size` sized minibatches of data (numpy.ndarrays)
        from the dataset `x`, `y`.

    Examples
    -------
    Simple batch extraction example:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    >>> N, D = 100, 3  # 100 datapoints with 3 features each
    >>> x = np.asarray([np.random.uniform(-10, 10, D) for _ in range(N)])
    >>> y = np.asarray([np.random.choice([0., 1.]) for _ in range(N)])
    >>> x.shape, y.shape
    ((100, 3), (100,))
    >>> x_placeholder, y_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float64), tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float64)
    >>> batch_size = 20
    >>> gen = generate_batches(x, y, x_placeholder, y_placeholder, batch_size)
    >>> batch_dict = next(gen)  # extract a batch
    >>> set(batch_dict.keys()) == set((x_placeholder, y_placeholder))
    True
    >>> batch_dict[x_placeholder].shape, batch_dict[y_placeholder].shape
    ((20, 3), (20, 1))

    Batch extraction resizes batch size if dataset is too small:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    >>> N, D = 10, 3  # 10 datapoints with 3 features each
    >>> x = np.asarray([np.random.uniform(-10, 10, D) for _ in range(N)])
    >>> y = np.asarray([np.random.choice([0., 1.]) for _ in range(N)])
    >>> x.shape, y.shape
    ((10, 3), (10,))
    >>> x_placeholder, y_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float64), tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float64)
    >>> batch_size = 20
    >>> gen = generate_batches(x, y, x_placeholder, y_placeholder, batch_size)
    >>> batch_dict = next(gen)  # extract a batch
    >>> set(batch_dict.keys()) == set((x_placeholder, y_placeholder))
    True
    >>> batch_dict[x_placeholder].shape, batch_dict[y_placeholder].shape
    ((10, 3), (10, 1))

    In this case, the batches contain exactly all datapoints:

    >>> np.allclose(batch_dict[x_placeholder], x), np.allclose(batch_dict[y_placeholder].reshape(N,), y)
    (True, True)
